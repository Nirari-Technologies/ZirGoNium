# ZirGoNium

ZirGoNium is a scripting language, based on Golang's syntax, with an open-sourced specification.

ZirGoNium's goal is to be an embeddable/extension scripting language with a focus on powerful C(++) interoperability, a light, expressive syntax, low developer friction, a lightweight runtime, and multi-script project scalability.
